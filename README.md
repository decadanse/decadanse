- 👋 Hi, I’m @decadanse
- 👀 I’m interested in what I'm learning stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 

LEARNING

- 	Linux (not only Linux like a system but also scripts on bash (if I can make smth faster/easier to use then why not)
- 	C++
      -    algorithms   
      -    math
      -    matrixs, vectors, dll
- 	Python: 
      -    writing in Mousepad and just terminal (but for some stuff SublimeText or Jupyter Notebook can be more comfortable),
      -    parsers stuff (like for images downloading, for getting some info, for whatever it can be needed), 
      -    sockets stuff, 
      -    scripts (like for reversing, disassembling (with pwn, sys, binascii and other needed libraries))
      -    encoder-decoder
      -    diagrams
- 	Matlab (math stuff)
- 	SimInTech (math, thermal detector sensor model using fuzzy logic)
- 	R (with Stepic "Анализ данных в R" course)
- 	Assembler (mainly Intel x86, x64) (https://beginners.re/ was quite helpful)
- 	Have experience with disassembly (IDA PRO, Ghidra, pwntools):
      -    learned with some 'crack-me' stuff, 
      -    challenges like: ctfspb, hackaday-u (you can find my papers with answers and how I got them here)
- 	Virtual machines, Docker
- 	Studying cybersecurity 
   mainly working with Kali Linux tools, 
   have experience with Windows security policie:
      -    Powershell
      -    ActiveDirectory 
      -    Kerberos 
-   HackTheBox and stuff like:
      -    nmap and other basic stuff for HTB
      -    TCP/UDP
      -    SQL
      -    BurpSuite

-   Some courses:
      -    Udemy - Python Networking and Security
      -    Sector7 RED TEAM OPERATOR courses
      -    eLearn
      -    CEHv11
      -    Reverse Engineering with Ghidra
      -    and other...
      -    and many many books...
