- 👋 Hi, I’m @decadanse
- 👀 I’m interested in what I'm learning stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 

LEARNING
•	Linux (not only Linux like a system but also scripts on bash (if I can make smth faster/easier to use then why not)
•	C++
•	Python: 
      writing in Mousepad and just terminal (but for some stuff SublimeText or Jupyter Notebook can be more comfortable),
      parsers stuff (like for images downloading, for getting some info, for whatever it can be needed), 
      sockets stuff, 
      scripts (like for reversing, disassembling (with pwn, sys, binascii and other needed libraries))
•	Assembler (mainly Intel x86, x64)
•	Have experience with disassembly (IDA PRO, Ghidra, pwntools):
    learned with some 'crack-me' stuff, 
    challenges like: ctfspb, hackaday-u (you can find my papers with answers and how I got them here)
•	Docker, Virtual machines
•	Have experience with Windows security policies.
•	Studying cybersecurity 
   mainly working with Kali Linux tools, 
   have experience with Windows security policie:
      Powershell
      ActiveDirectory 
      Kerberos 
   HackTheBox and stuff like:
      nmap and other basic stuff for HTB
      TCP/UDP
      SQL

Some of my code with what I'm learning stuff you can find here (some of them (almost all of them) you can find only on NotABug.org)
